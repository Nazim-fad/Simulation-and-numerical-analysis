# Simulation and Numerical Analysis

This repository contains some projects related to simulation and numerical analysis. The projects are written in Python and Jupyter Notebooks, sometimes there are web app versions of the projects. You can also find some theoritical results in the projects (mostly inside the notebooks and sometimes in pdf files).

This repository is a work in progress, so I will be adding whatever I find interesting. I hope you find something useful here.

You can use whatever you find here for any purpose. If you find any mistakes or have any suggestions, please let me know.
